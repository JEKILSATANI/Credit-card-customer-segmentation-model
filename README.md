Segment 2: High-Value Credit Users (Revolvers)
Representing a highly profitable customer base, these individuals primarily use their credit cards as a borrowing tool. They hold the highest average balance of $5,000 and cash advance totals of $5,000. Their spending behavior is characterized by a lower frequency of purchases but a high rate of cash advance transactions, with an average frequency of 0.5 and 16 cash advance transactions. Only 3% of these customers make full payments on their balances.

Segment 3: High-Credit Prime Customers
Customers in this group are recognized for their high credit limits, averaging $16,000, and their responsible credit usage, with the highest percentage of full payments. This segment is ideal for strategies aimed at increasing both their credit limits and spending behavior.
